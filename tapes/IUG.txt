 
                INTERCHANGE PROGRAM LIBRARY ABSTRACTS

Interchange was name of the Interdata User Group.

This file has been extracted from  chapter 2 of the R21-03 Interchange
Library Catalog,  the original of which  can be found on  bitsavers. I
have merely reformatted it, and added  URLs, to make it easier to read
and use.

Tip for vim users: Map one of your function keys to /^L^Mzt to quickly
'flip pages' by searching for embedded formfeed characters.

Note there are about 520 IUG tapes.  You cannot install all of them on
one 67MB disk. To install individual tapes:

* Create a disk labelled IUG by typing  'do makedisk iug'  at the simh
  prompt.  The newly-created disk  will automatically  be marked on by
  the sim script. If you want to keep the IUG volume 'mounted' after a
  reboot, do the following:

  Host:  Uncomment the 'attach  dm1' statement in os32.sim
  OS/32: Uncomment the 'mark dsc3:,on' statement in STARTUP.CSS.  

* If your IUG disk is not mounted on startup, you can also type this at
  the simh prompt:

  do mountdisk iug

* To restore  the  SOFTWARE TOOLS  tape  (e.g. to  use  lex,  yacc  or
  ratfor), type 'do iug 523' and the files will go onto the IUG volume
  under account number 523.

* Under MTM, type the following  commands to see the files in IUG:/523,
  and to return to your usual SYS:/25 directory.

  VOLUME IUG           VOLUME SYS
  SET PRIVATE 523      SET PRIVATE 25



IUG0101: MEMFILE
 
Category: UTIL        Language: CAL Macro/32             R-00 09/15/83
 
MEMFILE is  an E-Task which  makes use of  SVC intercepts to  create a
virtual device called  MEM:. A user task may assign  this 'device' and
through  it  read  all  of  configured  memory  in  either  random  or
sequential mode in 256 byte blocks, just as if memory were a read only
contiguous file. This program  is particularly valuable in conjunction
with DMPTYP IUG0491 and DUMPRINT.

IUG0102: OS/32 ENHANCEMENTS
 
Category: OS&L        Language: CAL Macro/32             R-10 02/12/92
 
This  catalog  entry  has  been  opened  to  receive  enhancements  to
the  operating  system. Such  enhancements  can  be those  of  general
usefulness or for a specific application, such as specialized drivers.
Currently this package  contains enhancements to the  BIOC driver. The
OS  6.2.4/7.2/8.1  BIOC  enhancements include  minimum  write  timeout
specification, control  over type ahead buffer  length, suppression of
rubout echo,  a correction  to DCB40,  ability to  send a  line break,
sysgen clock specification which functions  on dial-in lines, reset of
CMD2 byte  to sysgen value  upon disconnect, and  several enhancements
required for smooth operation with the new intelligent modems.

An enhancement  to BIOC  is provided  which gives the  user an  8 line
history buffer. The  user may retrieve any of the  last 8 typed lines,
view it, then optionally execute it. Currently BIOC only allows you to
retrieve the single last line entered.

The panic dump module is enhanced with respect to generic discs.

BACKUP is changed to make CLOSE=REWIND the default.

CAL is  enhanced by the  addition of  new pseudo-ops and  start string
parms:  PASS/NPASS causes  CAL to  output to  the user's  terminal the
message 'Ending pass  nn' at the end of every  pass. NLSTP[ char]/LSTP
causes CAL  to suppress  from the symbol  table listing  those symbols
which  begin  with the  prefix  'char'  whose  default value  is  '@'.
LOUR/NLOUR  causes CAL  to  list only  unreferenced  symbols. Two  new
pseudo-ops, ALERT  & ERROR, allow  the user to force  warnings (ALERT)
and errors (ERROR) permitting one to delay until assembly time certain
checks whose evaluation is not possible at macro time.

BIAS, EXAMINE and MODIFY from the OS console are greatly enhanced. The
EXAMINE  display is  enhanced  to display  both  the absolute  address
and  the offset  with  respect to  the  bias. BIAS  now  has this  new
compatible format: BIAS N|+N|-N|*[TaskName][+N|-N]|null.  If N bias is
set  to  that  absolute value,  If  +  or  -  N bias  is  offset  from
the  current  value by  that  amount.  If  *[+N|-N]  the bias  is  set
to  the  start of  the  currently  'tasked'  task  plus or  minus  the
offset N.  If the  TaskName is included  it is  automatically 'tasked'
then  the bias  is set  accordingly. EXAMINE  has this  new compatible
format: EXAMINE  AddressExpr[,N|/AddressExpr][,fd]. An  AddressExpr is
N|+N|-N|^[+N|-N]|![+N|-N|]. N and +N indicate  the display is to start
N bytes  forward from  the bias  while -N begins  the display  N bytes
before the  current bias. "^" is  a variable whose value,  initially 0
and always  reset by the  BIAS command,  is the starting  address with
respect to the bias  of the last effective EXA command  while "!" is a
variable  whose  value, initially  0  and  always  reset by  the  BIAS
command, is the address of the byte one greater than that displayed by
the last effective  EXA command. MODIFY also sets "!"  in this manner,
but does  not set "^". MODIFY  has this new compatable  format: MODIFY
AddressExpr[,HalfwordData|null]*. "*"  means one or  more repetitions.
When a null  parm is encountered the corresponding  halfword in memory
is not  altered. As  a result of  MODIFY setting "!"  but not  "^" the
following  very  convenient  commands  are  possible:  EXA  1FEA,2;MOD
^,C830,8000;MOD !,4230,8076  followed by  simply EXA  ^/! to  view the
results. An additional form of  the MODIFY command allows registers in
the 'tasked'  task to be modified:  MODIFY Rn[,FullwordData|null]*. Rn
is the starting  register where n is  in [0,F]. A null  parm skips the
corresponding register.

The changes and enhancements offered in this package are provided only
in  source updater  format, you  must apply  them youself  against the
appropriate source modules.

A  series of  new console  commands  are implemented:  XCANCEL -  same
as  cancel  except  no  error  is generated  if  task  isn't  present;
$IFTASK/$IFNTASK  execute/skip  commands  if  named  task  is  loaded;
$IFWCS/$IFNWCS  - execute/skip  commands  if  processor supports  WCS;
$IFOS/$IFNOS N.M - execute/skip commands  if OS version is N.M. $QUERY
- Use like a $WRITE. The text string is written to the console with an
appended question mark  to which a "yes" or "no"  response is required
setting the EOT code to zero or nonzero.

Contributed  by CCUR  as  a useful,  but  unsupported, program,  XAIDS
is  intended  only for  the  experienced  systems programmer  for  use
in  operating  systems  work.  XAIDS  is  substituted  for  UBOT  when
generating an OS. When so installed XAIDS takes control of the illegal
instruction trap and  may be used to  insert breakpoints, disassemble,
display register sets,  etc. Users with their  own specialized drivers
should find this a valuable diagnostic tool.

IUG0109: GLOBALLY ACT ON A SPECIFIED FILE DESCRIPTOR PATTERN
 
Category: UTIL        Language: CAL Macro/32, FORTRAN    R-01 08/01/86
 
Allows a user at an MTM  terminal (or the system console) to construct
and execute  a CSS command (GB)  that applies to all  files that match
the specified file pattern. For example,

GB X-.-,DE &F.&E would delete all files that begin with an X.

GB -.FTN,$IFNX  &F.OBJ\COMPILE &F\$ENDC  would compile all  .FTN files
that  did  not have  a  corresponding  .OBJ  file.  In the  above,  &F
substitutes for the filename, &E for the extension, other fields found
in the D F  listing are similarly represented. The "\"  acts as a line
separator, allowing multiple commands on a single line.

GB :-.-,$IF  CH &V:&F.&E NE &V:GB.EXE\DEL  &V:&F.&E\$ENDC would delete
all files  in the  users account  on all  accessible volumes.  The $IF
CH...is needed  to avoid  trying to delete  GB.EXE which  contains the
constructed commands. For this command to work of course all the users
files to be deleted must be unprotected and unassigned.

IUG0116: SAN DIEGO ENVIRONMENT CONTROL MANAGER
 
Category: UTIL        Language: CAL Macro/32             R-25 02/12/92
 
The  Environment Control  Manager (SDECM/32)  provides facilities  for
terminal users  to transfer control  of their terminals  between local
monitor  tasks as  well  as  to access  remote  processor systems  via
PENnet.  Access is  also provided  to locally  written monitor  tasks.
Monitor tasks include Reliance and MTM. Transfer of control is subject
to the  task being  able to  accept and  interpret the  'ADD terminal'
command sent by SDECM/32. SDECM will  control up to 126 terminal pairs
(BIOC/ITAM) to  provide easy  transition between  MTM and  Reliance. A
functional variation supporting nonpaired lines will support up to 253
terminals.  A  'screen  saver'  feature clears  the  screen  of  local
terminals after  10 minutes  of no use.  A 'modem  disconnect' feature
disconnects a  phone line after  1 minute of  no use. These  times are
configurable. A 'I/O  Count' feature tabulates the number  of I/O's on
each terminal and sends an alert to the OS console when a configurable
threshold is exceeded. Disconnected terminal  lines can ring and swamp
the system with  interupts consuming large amounts  of processor time.
This warning will alert you to the source of the problem.

use to sites which have a large number of independent users. Users can
request a file  be archived by a single command.  The option to delete
the file from disc after archiving  is available. The user is informed
at the time of  the request of the tape number to  which the file will
be  archived. The  actual  archiving  is performed  at  a later  date,
according to a schedule established  at the installation. The operator
can archive files on all volumes with a single command. Audit logs are
produced  of all  file  archive  requests and  of  all files  actually
archived.

IUG0126: NBS LIBRARIAN
 
Category: UTIL        Language: FORTRAN                  R-00 02/08/85
 
The NBS Librarian is a program for cross referencing object modules in
files.  This cross  referencing is  by external  reference/entry point
pairs.  The  Librarian  scans  files  containing  object  modules  and
produces a cross reference map and assigns a static link level to each
object module.  Given a  set of  unique entry  points defined  in some
number of  modules with no recursion,  there exists a static  link map
which is a directed tree. The static  link level is the level in which
a module  would be placed  such that it is  one lower than  the lowest
module calling it.

Category: UTIL        Language: C                        R-01 04/27/85
 
This is the now-famous state-of-the-art public domain data compression
program  "compress" which  has been  ported  to OS/32  by its  author.
This  program uses  a new  technique called  "modified Lempel-Ziv"  to
compress files  down to sizes  that were  never thought possible  in a
data-independent algorithm.  This program will help  you alleviate the
ever-pressing  problem of  disk space.  All previously  developed text
compression programs are  made obsolete by this  program. In addition,
binary files are  handled correctly. A program is  included to perform
operations on multiple files based on a Display Files pattern.

IUG0132: DEVWAIT - COORDINATE DEVICE RESOURCES
 
Category: UTIL        Language: CAL MACRO/32             R-00 04/15/85
 
A program which as its start string accepts a list of device names. It
attempts to  assign each  of these ERW.  Those which  are successfully
assigned remain  assigned, those  which cannot  be assigned  are tried
again after  10 seconds. This cycle  repeats until all devices  in the

IUG0134: WAIT - WAIT FOR OPERATOR RESPONSE OR TIMEOUT
 
Category: UTIL        Language: CAL MACRO/32             R-06 06/12/86
 
WAIT is designed to be inserted in a CSS stream as follows: LO WAIT ST
,!Q[uiet],T[imeout]=seconds  generating  the  message "Hit  RETURN  to
continue>". Entering the  RETURN key causes WAIT to go  to EOT code 0,
any other  entry results in  EOT code 2.  Not responding results  in a
timeout and EOT code 1. By testing the EOT code you may direct further
execution of  the CSS.  The !QUIET  parm suppresses  the sending  of a
bell, i.e.  control G,  with the  message. The  TIMEOUT period  may be
stated, but  if not  it defaults to  5 seconds. If  started with  ST ,
!H[elp] a  description of the use  of the program is  displayed on the
user's screen. All  possible error conditions are  diagnosed. The time
remaining is displayed  as it is counted down. Besides  being a useful
program it is a thoroughly commented  example of the use of task queue
traps, proceed I/O and timer completion queue entry.

A full duplex  PALS/PASLA/COMM-MUX driver for use with  CRT's and like
devices. Supporting ASCII,  IMAGE or BINARY modes.  Separate DCB's are
required for the read side (even address) and write side (read address
+1).  Because it  is a  full duplex  driver it  allows you  to post  a
proceed read followed by a write  without first halting the read. This
driver is  incompatible with MTM. Lack  of options is traded  for full
duplex operation and less processor load.

CONEX is a systems utility that  allows any MTM terminal to become the
system  console. It  is useful  to systems  personnel, programmers  or
anyone  needing access  to  the system  console.  By swapping  certain
identifying and  control information  between terminal DCB's,  the MTM
terminal actually  becomes the system  console and the  system console
becomes  the user's  MTM terminal.  Another execution  of the  utility
restores the original  state. The utility, which will  only execute if
the user  has E-task  load privileges,  is password  protected against
unauthorized use.

IUG0152: DIR - DIRECTORY SEARCH FACILITY
 
Category: OS&L        Language: CAL Macro/32             R-01 10/02/87

DIR is a relocatable E-task which creates a pseudo-device DIR:. A user
program, which  does not  require any  special privileges,  may assign
this pseudo-device and perform directory  reads from any existing disc
volume. These requests may be  'wild card' specifications, in the same
format  as the  'display  files'  command, limited  only  by the  user
program account privileges.

Supplied with  this package are  two user  programs which use  the DIR
facility. A 'files' program which allows  an MTM user with ACP display
files  capability with  account  number specification,  and a  'space'
program which reports  the amount of disc space occupied  by any 'wild
card' file specification on one or all volumes.

Besides  being very  useful  in its  own right,  DIR  is an  excellent
example of the power of intercepts to extend the OS capabilities.

of a difficult word. I find it useful and you may too! To use SPELL in
response to the  prompt "Enter your 'WORD' >...." you  enter your best
guess, or alternatively  your first suggested spelling  may be entered
immediately thus: SPELL 'my-word'. The  program responds with a screen
of 27 words  with the closest in  the center. If your  word is spelled
correctly, it is  highlighted. At this point you may  enter a new word
or you may  scan forward by entering  a '+' or backward  by entering a
'-'. The spelling dictionary contains 50,000 words. You may edit it to
add or delete words at will.

Category: UTIL        Language: Pascal                   R-00 08/05/87

In many cases when  a problem occurs with a disc  volume that has been
damaged, it is only the integrity of the data in the volume descriptor
that has  been lost.  The volume descriptor  contains pointers  to the
disc  structures  that  are  necessary  to read  files  on  the  disc.
Fortunately there is usually enough  redundant information on the disc
to reconstruct the volume descriptor but  the effort required to do so
manually can be prohibitive. The  process of reconstructing the volume
descriptor  is  mechanical enough  that  this  task can  be  performed
automatically.

IUG0178: FASTLINK - A HIGH SPEED LINKER
 
Category: UTIL        Language: CAL MACRO/32             R-00 03/03/88

FASTLINK  is a  modification to  LINK/32 which  reduces by  up to  260
times  the I/O  from object  libraries during  the link  process. This
is  accomplished  by preprocessing  once  the  sites object  libraries
effectively blocking them by 260. Thus  a single I/O will bring in 260
126 byte object records. Unblocked object libraries are recognized and
used correctly, although no speedup will be obtained. Thus FASTLINK is
a  functional replacement  for LINK/32.  Library blocking  is done  by
SINGLE.CSS whose operation is self explanitory. Blocked libraries will
have a record  length of 32,760 with  a data block size of  128 and an
index block size of 1.

Allows SVC calls 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 14 and 15 with many
variations from FORTRAN programs.

Most data communication applications present a common class of complex
problems.  Usually  a  good  degree of  operating  system  support  is
required to efficiently implement  solutions. OS/32 provides this kind
of support  through ITAM, Terminal  Managers and SVC 15  Line Drivers.
However  the  traditional  user  interface to  these  facilities,  via
assembly language,  is rather complex.  In the past,  real programming
examples  were  not  generally  available. This  high  level  language
interface package provides solutions to these difficulties. While this
package supports asynchronous, synchronous and Ethernet communications
under OS/32,  it also provides  the user  with a comprehensive  set of
coding examples. Also  included is an SVC  Intercept implementation of
UDP Datagram  Sockets for Ethernet  and a file transfer  mechanism for
use under OS/32 and Unix systems.

IUG0519: DP - DISC PATCH
 
Category: UTIL        Language: CAL Macro/32             R-03 11/10/87

DISC PATCH (DP) is a completely new replacement for DISCUPD, with much
enhanced utility.  Its commands  have been  modeled after  Edit/32 and
Copy/32 to quickly allow the user  to become familiar with its use. DP
commands include  Chain, which  outputs the  primary directory  to the
list device. Directory, which will decode a requested directory entry.
Display,  which displayes  a user  specified range  of sectors.  Find,
which  searches the  directory for  a user  specified fd.  Info, which
displayes basic  information about the  volume. Get and  Modify, which
allow the user to edit sectors. Many additional commands are provided,
including on line Help.

Along with this  power comes risks. DP will allow  you to edit sectors
directly,  thus  you can  destroy  the  disc's structure,  or  ideally
restore a corrupted disc.

IUG0523: SOFTWARE TOOLS
 
Category: UTIL        Language: FORTRAN & RATFOR         R-03 01/28/90

The SOFTWARE  TOOLS package as  generated by the Software  Tools Users
Group  is  an extensive  collection  of  portable software  which  had
its  roots  in the  book  SOFTWARE  TOOLS  by Kernighan  and  Plauger.
This  collection  is   so  extensive  that  it   would  be  impossible
to  provide  a  detailed  description  here. A  few  examples  of  the
tools  are:  RATFOR..a  preprocessor   which  translates  RATFOR  into
FORTRAN,  AR..an archive  file maintainer,  CH..change text  patterns,
COMM..print lines common to  two files, CMPRESS..compress input files,
CRYPT..encrypt  and  decrypt   standard  input,  DC..desk  calculator,
DIFF..isolate  differences  between  files,  EXPAND..uncompress  input
files,   FIELD..manipulate  fields   of  data,   FORMAT..format  text,
LAM..laminate  files,   LEX..generate  a  lexical   analyzer,  LISP..a
reasonably well-endowed LISP interpreter, MACRO..general purpose macro
processor,  MCOL..multicolumn  formatting,   ROFF..a  text  formatter,
SPELL..locate  spelling  errors,  TSORT..topologically  sort  symbols,
XREF..make  a cross  reference of  symbols, YACC..generate  a compiler
from a  yacc compiler specification.  A spelling dictionary  of 42,000
words  is included  for use  by the  SPELL utility.  At 1600  BPI this
package alone requires 1200 feet of tape.

IUG0525: SELECTOR AND COMPARE
 
Category: UTIL        Language: FORTRAN                  R-00 09/29/83

SELECTOR copies records from an input file or device to an output file
or device with the option  of selecting particular fields and records.
It can unblock tapes and convert  from EBCDIC to ASCII in the process.
Blanks or other text can be inserted into the output. COMPARE compares
selected fields  from two  files. All  records that  do not  match are
listed as they  exist on both files with  the differences highlighted.
Up to 20 fields may be selected to form the compare key.
