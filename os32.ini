# SHUTDOWN.CSS. STARTUP brings up MTM and anything else you may want, such
# as the spooler. SHUTDOWN cancels those tasks and marks non system disks
# off, after which it tells us to mark the system disk off and power down
# (which cannot be done inside a CSS file).

   # Paper Tape Punch/Reader, PTPR:
   #
   # - pt0 appears to be read end since only it supports readonly.
   # - pt1 does not allow readonly so I presume it must be the punch.
   #
   # You SHOULD be able to execute a CSS simply by typing PTPR: at
   # the MTM prompt. But I'm getting "I/O ERROR, TYPE=DU". What's
   # DU? If you use COPY32 to COPY PTPR:,CON:, it says "DEVICE
   # UNAVAILABLE". Same thing happens at the system console. Maybe
   # the device needs to be marked on in some way? But MARK PTPR:,ON
   # does not work.
