OS/32 kit :

   - Make available on github.

   - EIEIO

   - BATCH support. Want to SUBMIT jobs. Does this require SPOOLER?


FTP server :

   - FTP ADD[USER] command.

   - Configurable autostop. FTP STOP after this many minutes.

   - Option to [temporarily] open up for one connection, then close the
     listening socket. Already connected client sockets can carry on as
     long as they remain connected.

   - Is STOR timeout working?

   - Look out for BROKEN SOCK errors slipping through and bringing the
     whole thing down.

   - Add global try/except and bgerror to:

     - Avoid dying.
     - Avoid leaving the dimmer on.
     - Avoid leaving temporary files around.

   - APPE, STOU
