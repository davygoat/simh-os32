- Figure out tapes (labelled/unlabelled). COPY User Guide 3.2.2 and 3.2.3.
  OS/32 supports ANSI labelled tapes, but only 'single file, multiple
  volume' (Appendix D). This might work if I can handle a tar file in
  OS/32 (knock up a simple tar util). 3.2.3.2 and Appendix E refer to a
  Tape Labeller program.

- There is also an ANSI tape program on the IUG tapes (IUG0199), but I
  haven't found any instructions for it.

- Figure out Paper tape reader/punch?

- ECM/VCF ?
