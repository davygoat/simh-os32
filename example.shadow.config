   # Let's  say you  have a  raspberry or  a beaglebone  on a  static IP

   # laptop, each one having its own IP addresses.

   # To create a named user who defaults to the 25 account, but can also
   # get into other accounts, use an asterisk to give them that extended
   # access. You can also remove  dangerous commands by adding something
   # like -DELE to the list.
   #
   # By default, you'll  use MTM for authentication, which  is neat, but
   # takes a  few seconds. Or you  can use a separate  password for FTP,
   # which has the additional advantage  of being hashed, and its faster
   # than doing an MTM signon. Your password should be salted and hashed
   # with something like this:
   #
   #     echo "david/needle nardle noo!" | md5sum
   #
   #set access(david) { 25 * }
   #set passwords(david) 78acfd6de*************378276a3e6

   #
   # Here's how to get readonly anonymous ftp with a blank password.
   #
   # echo "anonymous/" | md5sum
   #
   #set access(anonymous) { 99 RO }
   #set passwords(anonymous) 51dde3a631b82a549ff793f540f65e6e

   #
   # What if your anonymous user has readonly access, but you DO want to
   # let them upload files? Simply add back the STOR command with a plus
   # (+STOR).
   #
   #set access(anonymous) { 99 RO +STOR }

   #
   # Once  you're happy  that  your configuration  is working,  consider
   # disabling  debugconfig,  because  it  shows you  the  hashes. When
   # you are ready, just uncomment the next statement.
   #
   #set debugconfig 0
