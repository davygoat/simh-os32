    # the initial working directory.  Additional directories can also be

    # directory 25 and their group directory 20; but nothing else.

    # element is an asterisk, user will  start off in the system account
    # 0. This is the case with the "operator" account.

    # own password for our purposes.  Use the md5sum command to generate
