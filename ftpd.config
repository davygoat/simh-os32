    # define host as  your machine's IP address, i.e. the  IP address of
    # your network interface.

    # A high numbered port lets you  run without root privilege. But the
    # standard 21 will  be much more convenient if you  are running in a
    # container; especially if you want to use the Microsoft Windows FTP
    # client, which can only use port 21.

    #
    # OS/32 uses numeric  accounts instead of named users, but we'll use
    # an array (key/value pairs) called "access", indexed  by name.
    #
    # The value  part can have  multiple numeric elements, the  first of
    # which is the initial working directory. Additional directories can
    # also  be given,  for  example user1  (25) can  go  into their  own
    # directory 25 and their group directory 20; but nowhere else.
    #
    # If the value part contains an asterisk, in addition to any numeric
    # accounts, the  user will be  have access  to all accounts.  If the
    # first and only  element is an asterisk, the user  will have access
    # to all accounts and start off in the system account 0. This is the
    # case with the "operator" user.
    #
    # There are two types of users:
    #
    # - Password authenticated  users.  These  are let  in if  their MD5
    #   hashed password matches. The hash is salted with the username to
    #   prevent hash collisions.
    #
    #   Example:
    #
    #   $ echo "david/cor blimey!" | md5sum
    #
    # - MTM based authentication. These do  not have an MD5 password, so
    #   we try to SIGNON using a terminal session.
    #
    # Password  authentication  is faster,  but  MTM  is more  "elegant"
    # because the user can change their password "online", under OS/32.
