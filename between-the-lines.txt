Tapes :

- C_Deb_Pas		installed (C). Debugger? Pascal?
- OS32_Pascal		installed: pascal compiler.
- FortranVII		installed: development and optimising compiler
- UnvFortrSwPkg		universal Fortran compiler

- sortMergeII		reads ok, but implies COBOL
- DMS32			reads ok, but implies COBOL, possibly Fortran
- OS32Medit		reads ok, needs terminal config
- IUG tapes		software tools works, lots of things don't (3200?)

- sort-merge		does not read
- COBOLupgrd		does not read

Tips/quirks :

- MTM copy, rename, etc. cannot "see" file with /99 type account ref.

- Use SET PRIVATE and SET GROUP to switch accounts, and to copy files
  between accounts.

- $DEF 1,,DVOL(SYS)           default volume for /s
- $DEF 1,,VOL(FD)             volume component of file name
- $DEF 1,,FILE(FD)            name component of file name
- $DEF 1,,EXT(FD)             extension component of file name
- $DEF 1,,ACC(FD)             account component of file name

- $DEF 1,,ST(@@=/I.NPLACE/) LD2 ST(OFF) GO0 CL(T) ST(ON)

  - pattern matching?
  - LD2
  - GO0
  - CL(T) ?

  2 (p22) for $IF operators.


BREAK :

- Hit telnet escape char, Ctrl/]
- Type SEND BRK.
- Wait for asterisk prompt.
- Type CANCEL.


SIGNON :

- SIGNON name,account,password.
- Ctrl/E before password disables echoing during password.
- Or type SIGNON without parameters for dialog version.

  - USERID is a unique session name (your alias).
  - ACCOUNT is the numeric account. Who you *really* are.
  - PASSWORD is your password.
  - ENVIRONMENT is the name of a CSS to run instead of USERINIT.

- SIGNON without parameters does not echo USERID or PASSWORD.


MTM privileges :

- SET GROUP
- SET PRIVATE
- EXTENDED ACCOUNT ACCESS (80808080 ?)
- PRIVILEGED
- Others? Which bits mean what?

- CHECK
- CLOSE
- CLOSEONLY
- COMMAND
- DIRECTORY
- END
- EXTENDALLOWED
- FILL
- INITIALISE/INITIALIZE
- KEEPSPOOL
- LIST
- NO
- NOREADCHECK

Some preinstalled programs :

- ECM: Environment Control Manager
- VCF: Virtual Console Faciltiy
- FXH: Series 7000/3200 File Transfer Handler
- IPCARCH: IPC Archive Utility
- MLU32: Macro Library Utility


Problems :

- MTM seems to do a lot of "busy work". CPU usage can get quite high
  after a while.
